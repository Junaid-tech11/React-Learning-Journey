# WEB Bundlers

- Web bundlers are tools that take your source code and assets and bundle them together into a single file or a few files that can be easily included in a web page. They help optimize the loading of your web application by reducing the number of HTTP requests and improving performance.
- Some popular web bundlers include Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel. These tools allow you to write modular code using JavaScript modules, and they handle the process of bundling and optimizing your code for production.
- Web bundlers also support features like code splitting, which allows you to split your code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand, and tree shaking, which removes unused code from your final bundle to reduce its size.
- Overall, web bundlers are essential tools for modern web development, helping developers manage and optimize their codebase and improve the performance of their web applications.

# Webpack- Webpack

- is a popular open-source JavaScript module bundler. It takes your JavaScript files and their dependencies and bundles them into a single file or a few files that can be included in a web page. Webpack also supports features like code splitting, tree shaking, and hot module replacement, which allows you to update your code without refreshing the page. It is widely used in modern web development and has a large ecosystem of plugins and loaders that extend its functionality.

- Rollup- Rollup is another popular JavaScript module bundler that focuses on optimizing the output for production. It uses a technique called "tree shaking" to remove unused code from the final bundle, resulting in smaller file sizes. Rollup is often used for bundling libraries and packages that will be consumed by other projects, as it produces clean and efficient bundles. It also supports features like code splitting and dynamic imports, making it a powerful tool for modern web development.

# Parcel-

- Parcel is a zero-configuration web application bundler that aims to provide a simple and efficient development experience. It automatically detects and handles various types of assets, including JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and images, without requiring any configuration. Parcel also supports features like hot module replacement, code splitting, and tree shaking out of the box. It is designed to be fast and easy to use, making it a popular choice for developers who want a hassle-free bundling solution for their web applications.

# npm is known as Node Package Manager.

- It is a package manager for JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. npm allows developers to easily share and reuse code by providing a registry of packages that can be installed and managed with simple commands. It also helps manage dependencies and versioning of packages, making it easier for developers to maintain their projects. With npm, developers can quickly install and update packages, making it an essential tool for modern web development.

# 2 types of npm packages are:

1. Local packages: These are packages that are installed and used within a specific project. They are typically installed using the command `npm install <package-name>` and are stored in the `node_modules` directory of the project. Local packages are only accessible within the project they are installed in.
2. Global packages: These are packages that are installed globally on your system and can be accessed from any project. They are typically installed using the command `npm install -g <package-name>`. Global packages are useful for command-line tools and utilities that you want to use across multiple projects without having to install them separately in each project.

# package.json and package-lock.json

- are two important files in a Node.js project that manage dependencies and project metadata.

- package.json: This file contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, description, and author. It also lists the dependencies required for the project to run. When you run `npm install`, npm reads the dependencies listed in package.json and installs them in the node_modules directory.
- package-lock.json: This file is automatically generated when you run `npm install` and contains
  a detailed record of the exact versions of all installed dependencies, including their dependencies. It ensures that the same versions of packages are installed across different environments and helps with reproducibility. When you share your project with others, they can use the package-lock.json file to install the exact same dependencies as you have, ensuring consistency in the development environment.

# files to ignore in gitignore:

- node_modules/: This directory contains all the installed dependencies for your project. It can be very large and is not necessary to include in version control since it can be easily recreated by running `npm install`.
- dist/: This directory typically contains the bundled and optimized files generated by a web bundler like Webpack. It is not necessary to include these files in version control since they can be generated from the source code.
- .env: This file often contains sensitive information such as API keys and environment variables. It should not be included in version control to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- .DS_Store: This is a hidden file created by macOS that stores custom attributes of a folder. It is not necessary to include this file in version control as it is specific to the operating system and does not contain any relevant code or data for the project.
